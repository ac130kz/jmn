    <!--
        NOTE: It is better to build against a known binary kept in source
              control than to build against whatever version of the IDE
              you happen to be running. This helps promote consistency 
              between developers on the team, since they will be able to 
              produce exactly the same build from any machine. In fact, 
              they will be able to reproduce historical builds by using
              the tag/branch (or similar) features of their source control
              system.
 
              The technique I use here is inspired and loosely based on the 
              platform.xml script from Jaroslav Tulach's dvbcentral project.

              I produced the platform used here by taking a development 
              build of NB 6.5 IDE, renaming its directory to nb65platform, 
              moving several textfiles in the root directory to a 'notices'
              subdirectory (to avoid clutter), removing the subdirectories 
              of the clusters I didn't need (to save space) and then I
              zipped the whole directory up.  Most of those steps are 
              optional; you could just use a NetBeans IDE zip file and
              change the 'platform.zip' property to reflect its name and
              also change the 'platform.dir' property to reflect the name
              of the directory it creates when unpacked.
